This project aims to create a Game Boy emulator web-application, in other words a program capable of receiving Game Boy game files (commonly referred to as ROMs), and interpreting such ROM to play the game, or execute the program, it contains. The emulator will be usable in browsers, for both desktop computers and mobile devices that may not have access to a physical keyboard. The emulator will also contain debugging capacities, to allow other emulator developers to use it when comparing with their emulator and working on it.

The objective of this project is to create a piece of software that could be used by anyone wanting to emulate retro games, without the need for any technical knowledge on emulators or downloading anything (except the ROMs that need to be obtained separately).
